# 4create

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.4.

## State management

Akita is not maintained anymore and doesn't work with latest version of Angular.

Because of that I created custom store implementation.

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```
